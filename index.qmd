<!-- 
:::: { .callout-important }

Do not wait until the last minute to contact me for help! I have a family and my
own classes.

If you have not [made an appointment](#appointments) during my office hours or 
[requested an appointment](#requesting-help-outside-of-office-hours)
outside my regular office hours in advance there may be little I can do to 
help you on short notice.

I will not be hurt or upset if you **book early and then cancel when you don't need 
help**^[Please cancel if possible. There is a button in your 
calendar event to cancel to make it easy to do so.].
Book something then cancel instead of emailing me at the last minute please.

# Office Hours

If you are already at Harbor Walk feel free to drop by during my office hours ({{< meta office >}}).

## Center for Student Learning Office Hours

# Appointments

You don't need to book an appointment for office hours, but please e-mail me if it is during my posted hours and I don't immediately let you in to my zoom meeting.

<!-- You don't **need** to make an appointment for my office hours; however, I do have a 
family and may have things come up. 
If you know you want to see me then making an appointment will be helpful both in 
that if something comes up I know who I need to reschedule, and additionally I can 
get an idea of what you need to discuss. 
[Book an appointment]({{< meta booklink >}}){.external target="_blank"}.

I am happy to help out either in person or via zoom, but for zoom based help 
please make an appointment. 
Tuesday evening hours that are **Appointment Only** will be offered by zoom appointment.
