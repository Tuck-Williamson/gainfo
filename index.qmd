Graduate Student - Masters in Computer Science, College of Charleston

:::: { .callout-important }

Do not wait until the last minute to contact me for help! I have a family and my
own classes.

If you have not come by or made an appointment during my office hours or 
[requested an appointment](#requesting-help-outside-of-office-hours)
outside my regular office hours in advance there may be little I can do to 
help you on short notice.

::::

<!-- 
I will not be hurt or upset if you **book early and then cancel when you don't need 
help**^[Please cancel if possible. There is a button in your 
calendar event to cancel to make it easy to do so.].
Book something then cancel instead of emailing me at the last minute please.

# Appointments

You don't **need** to make an appointment for my office hours; however, I do have a 
family and may have things come up. 
If you know you want to see me then making an appointment will be helpful both in 
that if something comes up I know who I need to reschedule, and additionally I can 
get an idea of what you need to discuss. 
[Book an appointment](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLkdXRgxcd-Y0421rsf8eSL7usSYazPWt39RCxtxPVBMG6kA/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1128249813=340+-+Appointment+on+%3CDATE%3E+at+%3CTIME%3E&entry.1016115638=I+would+like+to+meet+with+you+%3CIN+PERSON+or+VIA+ZOOM%3E.%0A%3CWHAT+YOU+WANT+TO+SEE+ME+ABOUT%3E).


I am happy to help out either in person or via zoom, but for zoom based help 
please make an appointment. 

## Requesting Help Outside of Office Hours

If my office hours are not compatible with your schedule please [message me and I will try and work something out.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLkdXRgxcd-Y0421rsf8eSL7usSYazPWt39RCxtxPVBMG6kA/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1128249813=340+-+Request+for+non-office+hours+appointment&entry.1016115638=I+would+like+to+meet+with+you+%3CIN+PERSON+or+VIA+ZOOM%3E.%0ASome+dates+and+times+that+would+work+for+my+schedule+are:+%3CGIVE+ME+2%2B+OPTIONS%3E.%0A%0A%3CWHAT+YOU+WANT+TO+SEE+ME+ABOUT%3E){.external target="_blank"}
I will try and schedule time with you that works for both of our schedules including in evenings or weekends if necessary.


# Zoom Information
