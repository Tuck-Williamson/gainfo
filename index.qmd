# Appointments

You don't **need** to make an appointment for my office hours; however, I do have a 
family and may have things come up. 
If you know you want to see me then making an appointment will be helpful both in 
that if something comes up I know who I need to reschedule, and additionally I can 
get an idea of what you need to discuss. Use the `Book an appointment` link in this 
site's "Other Links" section.

I am happy to help out either in person or via zoom, but for zoom based help please 
make an appointment. Use the `Book a zoom appointment` link in this 
site's "Other Links" section.
