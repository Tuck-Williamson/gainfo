I have a family and my own classes.\nIf you have not made an appointment or requested an appointment outside my regular office hours in advance there may be little I can do to help you on short notice.\nI will not be hurt or upset if you book early and then cancel when you don’t need help1. Do that instead of emailing me at the last minute please."
