Graduate Student - Masters in Computer Science, College of Charleston


:::: { .callout-important }

Do not wait until the last minute to contact me for help! I have a family and my
own classes.

If you have not [made an appointment](#appointments) or 
[requested an appointment](#requesting-help-outside-of-office-hours)
outside my regular office hours in advance there may be little I can do to 
help you on short notice.

I will not be hurt or upset if you **book early and then cancel when you don't need 
help**^[Please cancel and don't just not show up. There is a button in your 
calendar event to cancel, so it's easy.].
Do that instead of emailing me at the last minute please.

# Appointments

You don't **need** to make an appointment for my office hours; however, I do have a 
family and may have things come up. 
If you know you want to see me then making an appointment will be helpful both in 
that if something comes up I know who I need to reschedule, and additionally I can 
get an idea of what you need to discuss. 
[Book an appointment]({{< meta booklink >}}){.external target="_blank"}.

I am happy to help out either in person or via zoom, but for zoom based help 
please make an appointment. 
Tuesday evening hours that are **Appointment Only** will be offered by zoom appointment.

## Requesting Help Outside of Office Hours

If my office hours are not compatible with your schedule please [request a meeting
with me using this link][reqOOOM]{.external target="_blank"}. I will try and 
schedule time with you that works for both of our schedules. 

Providing me with **at least three** options that would work for your schedule 
would be **helpful**.

[reqOOOM]: mailto:williamsonth@cofc.edu?subject=Request%20for%20a%20meeting%20outside%20of%20office%20hours.&body=I%20want%20to%20request%20a%20meeting%20outside%20of%20your%20office%20hours.%0A%0AI%20would%20be%20able%20to%20meet%20the%20following%20times%3A%0A1%3A%20%0A2%3A%0A3%3A%0A%0AThank%20you%2C%0A%0AYOUR_NAME_HERE


# Zoom Information

I will also be available via zoom during my office hours. If you want to have an
unscheduled zoom session with me during office hours you can try my personal 
meeting room (details below).


:::: { .callout-warning }

If I do not accept you into my meeting I may be busy with another student via zoom
or in person.

In such an event please either book an appointment ([see above](#appointments)) or 
[email me][email] and I will get back to you as soon as I can.
